        <br> Jammu & Kashmir tourism has been described as a paradise 
         so many times that one feels it is the ultimate homage
        <br> you could pay to it. But somehow, there is a vagueness 
        in it which does not do justice to this part of the country.
 
        <br>What is paradise in Jammu & Kashmir? It is its alpine
        meadows, crystal clear lakes, amber hues of the trees
        <br> during autumn, boathouses, gondolas, apple orchards 
        and everything else that is a part of its landscape.

      <br>  Kashmir is a state which is equally rich in
       <br> cultural and natural wonders along with the
       <br>  myriad of history and political past that 
       <br>  this state is home to. This state provides 
       <br> unique experiences to its tourists in the form
       <br>  of spicy native food along with a variety of
       <br>  teas, long walks or a jagged trekking experience
       <br>   on the many mountains in the region, marvelling
       <br>    at the cozy houseboats on the lakes of Srinagar 
       <br>   and visiting the many pilgrimage sites, temples
       <br>    and religious and spiritual centres that are 
       <br>    present throughout the state.
       <br>  If you love collecting souvenirs from the places
       <br>   you visit, then you can pick up the beautiful 
       <br>  Pashmina silks, carpets and other textiles 
       <br>  handcrafted by the native craftsmen in Kashmir. 
       <br>  These are some of the unique experiences you can 
       <br> face all in the same state! 
    </p>
    <p>
       <br> Kashmir is not just about the stunning scenic
       <br>  views but also known for its handicrafts and
       <br>  Kashmiri gift items. It is a well-known place
       <br>  for Pashmina shawls and blankets. Kashmiri 
       <br>  Carpets are famous worldwide because of its
       <br>   specialty of being handmade and rich in texture.
       <br>   It also enjoys an extravagant lavish culture
       <br>    with its gorgeous traditional dresses and 
       <br>     astonishing traditional jewelries. 
       <br> Kashmiri saffron is the rarest and the most
       <br>  expensive form of saffron available in the world.
       <br>  The reason for this is its limited production
       <br>  of just over 2000 kgs, which is very less as 
       <br> compared to other producers of saffron. Also,
       <br> what distinguishes Pure Kashmiri saffron from 
       <br> Italian, Spanish or Afghani Saffron is its
       <br> highest levels of safranal, crocin and picrocrocin.
       <br>  These three compounds are responsible for giving 
       <br>  kashmiri saffron its intense color, aroma and
       <br>   a deep pungent taste.

<div class="poem">
    <p>
<br>"Look around Kashmir, look around for what you see; 
<br>Oh! It will amaze you, this is what they guarantee
<br>The valley, the mountains, the rivers;
<br>Perceive the happiness and bliss it delivers
<br>Locals and tourists alike,
<br>A beauty that you would never be able to psych;
<br>Even though we all admit,
<br>People have sacrificed themselves for it;
<br>The beauty of Kashmir cannot be compared, 
<br>It is a place where different cultures are shared.
<br>A mythical site it may appear,
<br>If there's a heaven on Earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."
